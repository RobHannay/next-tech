Welcome to Blink! We're so glad you're here.

## ‚å®Ô∏è The task

By now you should have some ideas about what you want to make your chat bot do.

Go to `src/Blinkbot/respond.js` to start adding your responses.

## üí≠ I'm stuck

Some things to try:
- Can you see any errors or red underlines in your code editor?
- Open the console in the browser (Press `fn` + `F12`). Can you see anything helpful there?
- What happens if you put a different input in?

Still no luck? Don't worry! Just grab Rob to help out

## scripts

To run the app, open the Terminal and run

```shell
pnpm dev
```
