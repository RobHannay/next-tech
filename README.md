Congratulations on getting to this stage of the process. We're excited to see what you'll build.

## ‚å®Ô∏è The task

A chat app with these features.

## üì¶ Template

We've provided you with a very basic template to help you spend more time on the actual task, but you're welcome to add
other technologies that you think are helpful,

We've only included the lint rules from the Vite template. You're welcome to add more if they will help increase the quality of your submission!

We have:

- got React and TypeScript set up for you
- included the App.tsx file as the entry point
- added a very basic fetch chats.
- included an initial stylesheet, but please _show us what you can do_

We have not:

- structure the files in any particular way
- added any testing infrastructure; if you have time, use whatever tools you think are good
- added any opinionated styling tools or libraries

As always, you're welcome to wow us, show us what you can do! You don't even have to use this template at all, if you're more confident with a meta framework like Next.

This should work happily with the package manager of your choice, though we have only tested with `npm` and `pnpm`.

## üí≠ Your thoughts

We find it useful if you can document some of your thinking, including what you would improve given more time.
known issues and how you would resolve them given more time. Technical decisions, design decisions, compromises.
